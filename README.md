Description:
The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A key, which is a word or phrase, is used to select which alphabet to use when encrypting each letter of the plaintext. Our implementation extends this concept by creating a keystream that can be as long as the plaintext message, ensuring a more secure encryption scheme. The keystream is generated algorithmically, providing a unique and non-repeating key for messages of any length.
The project allows the user to generate a keystream using either an integer (int32) or a string as the seed. The keystream is then used to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenere cipher. The project is written in Python and is designed to be easy to use and understand.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/L0rikKelmendi/Projekti2-Siguri-t-Dhenave/
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd vigenere-keystream-cipher`
3. Install any required dependencies
4. Run the main Python script and follow the on-screen prompts to provide a seed value, select the operation you wish to perform (encrypt or decrypt), and enter the text you wish to process.
   
Results:

The project successfully generates a keystream based on the provided seed and uses it to encrypt or decrypt messages. Users can expect a secure and efficient implementation of the Vigenere cipher that can handle messages of arbitrary length without the need for a pre-shared key that is as long as the message itself.

Expectations:
By using this project, other developers and cryptography enthusiasts can learn about the Vigenere cipher and its modern application with keystream generation. They can also implement a secure communication system using the principles demonstrated in this project. Additionally, they can extend the codebase for additional features or to integrate the cipher into other software projects.
